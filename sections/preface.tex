I would like to open by saying how thankful I am for having the opportunity to be able to express my interest in foundational mathematics by formal means of writing a thesis. This is perhaps the best excuse for spending as much time as I have exploring this field of mathematics. Writing this thesis has been an extremely fun journey. I would like to thank Dr.\ K.P. Hart in particular for allowing me to diverge from the available list of projects for this thesis and venture into my own. His assistance has been very helpful throughout the development of this thesis. My ideas for the project started off way too broad, which was a direct consequence of my enthusiasm to delve into as much as possible in the field. As the project progressed the scope became more narrow. It is now what I believe to be a great midway between coverage and detail. With that, I wish you much pleasure in reading this thesis.

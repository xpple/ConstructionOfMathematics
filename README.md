# Construction of Mathematics
This repository contains the source files for an overview of set-theoretic constructions of mathematical objects. It is
intended to be an accessible introduction to foundational mathematics. This work started as my bachelor's thesis for my
study Applied Mathematics at Delft University of Technology. The first commit is the thesis I submitted.
